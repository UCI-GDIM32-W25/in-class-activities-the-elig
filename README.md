# In Class Activities
## Week 1
### Activity 1
Double check that itch.io and GitHub have properly updated when submitting any assignment. For example, open your itch.io link in an incognito tab to make sure it works.

### Activity 2
1. 10
2. 2
3. It would print "hello world" to the console every frame the program is running
4. MonoBehaviour
5. It would print "x = 10" to console at program start up
6. Argument. To send a variable into a method's parameter to allow more flexible use of methods (rather than hard coding every function)
7. You cannot directly call the class name Transform, as it isn't static. You have to call the instance variable of type Transform (_playerTransform)

### Activity 2
During class, I started/created all of the scripts and game objects, and put the relevant components on (most of) them. I also added the coin prefab and finished the jump logic. Here is the link to the [commit](https://github.com/UCI-GDIM32-W25/mg2-oop-review-the-elig/commit/389fd2a95e7abe81eb855e77a3a5a9c8b74d6167).
